# Stata MCP Server

This server enables you to manage and work with Stata `.do` files directly from Claude Desktop via a Desktop Extension. It provides a seamless interface for browsing, editing, and running Stata scripts within your configured Stata projects directory.

> **Note:** This project is a modified version of Anthropic's MCP filesystem server, originally released under the MIT license, with enhancements for Stata workflow integration.

## Features
- Browse, open, and edit Stata `.do` files from Claude Desktop
- Organize Stata projects in a user-configurable directory
- Secure, local-first design

## Quick Start
1. Install the Desktop Extension in Claude Desktop
2. Configure your Stata projects directory (default: `~/Documents/stata-projects`)
3. Start the server and begin working with your Stata `.do` files
